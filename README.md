This repository is my implementation of [Clox](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master/c) from the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom.  <br/> 
CLox is a C-Based interpreter for the toy language Lox, it contains no external libraries. <br/>
